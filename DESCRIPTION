Title: Fast Imputations Using 'Rcpp' and 'Armadillo'
Version: 0.5.0
Authors@R: person("Maciej", "Nasinski", email = "nasinski.maciej@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: 
  Fast imputations under the object-oriented programming paradigm.
	There was used quantitative models with a closed-form solution. Thus package is based on linear algebra operations.
	The biggest improvement in time performance could be achieve for a calculation where a grouping variable have to be used.
	A single evaluation of a quantitative model for the multiple imputations is another major enhancement.
	Moreover there are offered a few functions built to work with popular R packages such as 'data.table' or 'dplyr'.
