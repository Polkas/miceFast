## Test environments
* Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0
* local Windows 10, R 3.4.4
* win-builder: R-devel

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs,WARNINGs and a one NOTE.

I got a note only on travis-ci:
checking installed package size ...NOTE installed size is  8.4Mb
this is a problem of the size of compiled code.
